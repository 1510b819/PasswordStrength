# PasswordStrength

This project is a simple web-based Password Strength Checker that allows users to assess the strength of their passwords in real-time. It features a text input field for entering passwords, a strength meter that visually represents password strength, and a toggle button to show or hide the password. The password strength is evaluated based on length, character variety, and special characters, providing instant feedback on password security.
